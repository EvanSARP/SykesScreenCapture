# Shady's ScreenCaptureTool
Shady's ScreenCaptureTool (formerly Sykes ScreenCaptureTool) was published in June, 16th, 2015. 

It is the first application that I made with Visual Basic, however codes weren't improved and organized.

This application will be receiving no more updates, due to being outdated. Therefore, I do not recommend installing it as there're alternative applications.

## Features
* You can save the screenshot with any of the following formats â€” .jpg, .png, and .bmp.
* Application can be re-sized, so you can take screenshot of the part you want.
* Simple, using classic design and icons.
